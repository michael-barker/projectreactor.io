# Project Reactor Website

This is the source code for the Project Reactor home page. It also serves as an example
application of how to use Spring Web Reactive Framework, Reactor, and other web
technologies in a single project.

You can just run the application with:

		$ ./gradlew run

This project is Apache 2.0 licensed, just like the rest of Reactor.
